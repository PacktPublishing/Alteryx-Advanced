To properly download code files from a Git LFS-updated repository without corrupting the files, please follow these straightforward steps:
- Download and install the GitHub Desktop app from this link: https://desktop.github.com/?ref_cta=download+desktop&ref_loc=installing+github+desktop&ref_page=docs. Open the application and sign in with your GitHub credentials.
- In the GitHub Desktop app, navigate to "File" -> "Clone Repository."
- In the dialog that appears, paste the URL of the repository you wish to clone into the "URL" field. Below, choose a location on your local drive where you'd like to store the repository files and click "Clone."
- After cloning completes, a confirmation message will appear. Click "Show in Explorer" (or "Show in Finder" for Mac) to open the folder containing the cloned repository on your computer.
- Inside this local repository folder, you should find the code files. If the files are compressed (zipped), you may use a tool like 7Zip (downloadable from https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract them.

This method ensures you get an exact copy of the repository, including all files handled by Git LFS, ready for use on your system.
